### App to refresh my mind on electron development.

Creates a encrypted file on the first boot and asks you for a password to later on save contacts data in it, the second time you're going to login the file would already be created so you need to send the password to decrypt all the info. Once logged in you can perform CRUD operations and search.

# Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies with
   `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Run the dev server with `yarn dev`

(MacOS)- The config is saved in my case in this folder just in case you want to delete de config:

`/Users/<your user>/Library/ApplicationSupport/radix-contacts`
